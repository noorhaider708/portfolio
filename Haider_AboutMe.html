                              I am currently a Senior at Dublin High School in Dublin and I want to succeed in this school. I am striving to have three things, a job where I can get paid a good amount of money, a loving family, and a knowledgeable life. I want to get a job in engineering and I plan to focus on engineering throughout college. Personally, I am interested in engineering because of my general interest in technology. The science of how a computer works or how a complex video game works always intrigues me. My dad is also an engineer who manages at Cisco Systems and he is an inspiration to me. These are my motives to majoring in engineering throughout college. 

    During high school I have learned and achieved a lot of skills. Going into high school was a big change for me and I learned to adapt to my surroundings. Classes are harder but I have continued to maintain good grades. I have accomplished the skill of adaptation and taking advantage of my work area. I have adapted to the new school from the transition from middle school to high school. Having a lot of clubs and friends helps me use my work area. With clubs I can balance my time with extracurricular activities such as sports or community service. My friends serve as a good study group for me. I am participating in CSF and Interact Club which are both for serving the community. I also created the Super Smash Bros Club in my school which gained more than 60 members. We play a video game competitively and I've noticed that my club has brought a whole community in Dublin together because of the tournaments I host. People from my school, from other schools, and adults come to participate in the tournaments which is what I want from my club. 

    I have great skill and interest in technology due to being exposed to it at an early age. I am a very efficient and flexible person. When i'm working with a team, I am usually given a lot of work to complete, and when i'm done with that, I am able to help my partners complete their work too. I have also had a lot of experience with teamwork in sports. Playing on a baseball team has taught me how to work with others and to help each other out. Doing poorly with my team on a project or loosing a competitive game has helped me build up from my mistakes and improve on them. 

    Thank you for taking your time and reading about me. Please continue and read my other pages.
