                               <strong>Scratch Project 9/16/16 - Computer Science Engineering</strong>
                            </h3>
                            <p>
                                The objective of this project was to create a 
                                game or story on Scratch that contained multiple 
                                phases or stages. My partner and I decided to 
                                create a game based off the 1989 Nintendo Game 
                                Boy game Alleyway. To meet the requirement of 
                                multiple phases, we created two levels for the 
                                player to go through which increased in difficulty.
                                To create the game on Scratch we programmed the 
                                game together and separately on our own time. 
                                One major challenge was programming the ball 
                                to bounce off the blocks and afterward, making 
                                the blocks dissapear. Once we finished the main 
                                content, I polished the game with music, extra 
                                sprites, and "Game Over" screens. 
                                My partner and I relied on our communication 
                                skills to make sure we both knew what we wanted 
                                for the final version of the game. It all worked
                                out as we created a decent game -one of the better 
                                ones in the class- considering time constraints and 
                                little to no experience in Scratch.

                            </h3>
                            <p>
                                The objective of this project was to modify 
                                a set of pictures for a selected client who -for
                                us- wanted their brand on these pictures. 
                                My partner and I brainstormed and concluded that
                                we will create 2 modifications; one for a 
                                logo on the bottom right of the image and another
                                being a gray watermark overlayed on top of the 
                                whole image. My role for the project was mainly
                                to program the code that manipulates all the
                                images and help my partner with the documentation.
                                My partner did most of the documentation and 
                                helped me with some programming. Because my
                                partner and I have experience in engineering
                                documentation we were able to apply those skills
                                in this project. I learned that having organized
                                documentation saves time as well as having 
                                communication with your partner. The biggest 
                                challenge we faced was starting out our program
                                on the right path. We took a lot of time finding 
                                the best way to start and it ate away a lot of 
                                time. We overcame this challenge by asking another
                                group for assistance.

                            <p>
                                The objective of this project was to create an app 
                                using Android Studio and my group decided to make
                                a college app. My group brainstormed and concluded that
                                we would have liked to have an app that helped us 
                                with our college apps for reminders and other information 
                                while we went through that process ourselves.
                                My role for the project was mainly to design the app 
                                with a proto.io prototype, work on the documentation 
                                and presentation, and help out with the code.
                                Through this project I learned that having organized
                               code saves time as well as communicating with your partners 
                               often. The biggest challenge we faced was getting 
                               the real app to actually work. We didn't finish the complete 
                               app but we made a lot of progress by asking for help from 
                               other groups.
